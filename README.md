# PhdCode
The code I developed during my PhD research. The whole lot. Includes a surface curvature analyser, a shape deformation animator, and a few accompanying utilities.

PLEASE NOTE:

1. This code is pretty old. Over 10 years old at the time of uploading it on GitHub. It was developed using version 4.2 of Microsoft Visual Studio and MFC. I can no longer guarantee even that it will compile, let alone run. It is there only for reviewing and for picking up to reuse, in accordance with the MIT license that comes with it. 

2. Most 3D graphics were coded using the then current version of OpenInventor. The executables require a valid OpenInventor license in order to run. This license is not supplied in the code and needs to be obtained independently.

3. I was still a young developer when I was writing this code. I *thought* that I knew how to write good code, but after revisiting it recently I realised how many things I could have done differently. In fact, if I were to develop the same programs again, I would start from scratch and structure most things in a different way. Please understant that the intention of making it public is NOT to demostrate current coding skills, but to provide an idea of the workings on the algorithms and methods described in the thesis that came out of it.

I welcome all your comments, you can contact me on ioannis@douros.org

Thanks,
Yannis
